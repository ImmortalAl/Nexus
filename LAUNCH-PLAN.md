## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Beta)

### Phase 0: Critical Infrastructure
**Timeline: 3-5 days**

- [ ] **Version Synchronization Crisis**
  - Audit all 27+ files with version parameters
  - Standardize features.css to single version across all pages
  - Create version bump automation script
  - **Risk**: Inconsistent user experience, cache hell

- [ ] **Production Code Cleanup**
  - Remove 168+ debug console statements (preserve error logging)
  - Complete TODO in messageboard.html:1703 (edit history modal)
  - Implement message deletion capability
  - **Risk**: Performance degradation, incomplete features

- [ ] **Security Pre-Flight**
  - API endpoint security review (auth, rate limiting)
  - XSS vulnerability scan on user input fields
  - CSRF protection verification
  - **Risk**: Data breach, user trust damage
