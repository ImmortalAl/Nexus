## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Beta)

### Phase 0: Critical Infrastructure
**Timeline: 3-5 days**

- [x] **Version Synchronization Crisis** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Audit all 27+ files with version parameters
  - ✅ Standardize navigation.js to v=2.0 across all pages
  - ✅ Standardize shared styles.css to v=14.8 across all pages
  - ✅ Create version bump automation script (bump-versions.sh available)
  - **Risk**: MITIGATED - Consistent user experience restored

- [x] **Production Code Cleanup** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED
  - ✅ Remove 168+ debug console statements (preserve error logging)
  - ✅ Complete TODO in messageboard.html:1703 (edit history modal)
  - ✅ Implement message deletion capability
  - ⚠️ **Status**: Need to verify no new debug statements added
  - **Risk**: MITIGATED - Performance optimized, features complete

- [ ] **Security Pre-Flight** ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND
  - ✅ API endpoint security review (auth, rate limiting) - COMPLETED
  - ✅ XSS vulnerability scan on user input fields - COMPLETED
  - ✅ CSRF protection verification - COMPLETED
  - **Status**: 🚨 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED
  - **Blockers**:
    - 💥 CRITICAL: Database credentials exposed in .env file
    - 💥 CRITICAL: Overly permissive CORS configuration
    - ⚠️ HIGH: NoSQL injection vulnerability in auth route
    - ⚠️ HIGH: Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints
  - **Risk**: IMMEDIATE data breach risk, complete database compromise
