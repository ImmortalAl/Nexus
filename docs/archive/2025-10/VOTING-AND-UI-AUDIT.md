## ‚úÖ CHRONICLES VOTING STATUS

### Current State:
- **Using unified voting**: YES ‚úÖ (lines 469, 490 in chroniclesFeed.js)
- **Script loaded**: YES ‚úÖ (unifiedVoting.js v1.6 in news.html line 322)
- **Vote types**: 'upvote' (Consecrate) and 'challenge' (Investigate)

### Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate vote handling code** (lines 550-586)
   - Old `updateVotingUI()` method still exists
   - New `updateVotingUIFromUnified()` handles unified voting
   - **Fix**: Remove old method to avoid confusion

2. **Vote count display inconsistency**
   - Line 185: Uses `chronicle.validations.length`
   - Line 192: Uses `chronicle.challenges.length`
   - But unified voting returns `upvotes` and `challenges`
   - **Fix**: Ensure consistent naming

### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] Remove duplicate `updateVotingUI()` method (lines 550-586)
- [ ] Verify vote count field naming matches backend response
- [ ] Test consecrate/investigate buttons
- [ ] Check if vote state persists on page refresh

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ECHOES UNBOUND (MESSAGE BOARD) VOTING STATUS

### Current State:
- **Has vote buttons**: YES (lines 589-592, 1145-1146 in messageboard.html)
- **Using unified voting**: NEED TO CHECK ‚ùì
- **Script loaded**: NEED TO CHECK ‚ùì

### Code Found:
```javascript
// Lines 1835-1882 in messageboard.html
// Manual vote handling with apiClient.post()
// NOT using unified voting system
```

### Issues Found:
1. **NOT using unified voting system**
   - Uses custom implementation (lines 1835-1882)
   - Calls `/threads/${id}/vote` directly
   - Doesn't use `window.unifiedVoting.vote()`

2. **Vote counts hidden**
   - Line 1867: `voteCountElement.style.display = 'none'`
   - Intentionally hiding vote scores

3. **Vote state management**
   - Uses `response.currentVote` to track user's vote
   - Updates button active states manually

### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] Replace custom voting with `window.unifiedVoting.vote('thread', id, voteType)`
- [ ] Check if unifiedVoting.js is loaded in messageboard.html
- [ ] Test thread voting after migration
- [ ] Test reply voting after migration
- [ ] Verify anonymous thread voting still works

## üîç AVATAR SCROLL ISSUES

### Issue Identified (CORRECTED):
**The author avatar in Soul Scrolls modal WAS sticky - user wants it to scroll away with content!**

### Modals Status:
1. **‚úÖ Soul Scrolls (Blog) Modal** (`#blogModal`)
   - Header class: `.modal-header-bar`
   - Status: **FIXED** ‚úÖ
   - Was: `position: sticky; top: 0;` (made avatar follow scroll)
   - Now: `position: relative;` (avatar scrolls away with content)
   - File: `blog-modal.css` line 98

2. **‚úÖ Chronicle Modal** (`#chronicleModal`)
   - Header class: `.chronicle-detail-header`
   - Status: **ALREADY CORRECT** ‚úÖ
   - Has: `position: relative;` (avatar scrolls away naturally)
   - No changes needed

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Thread Modal** (Echoes Unbound)
   - Status: **NOT FOUND** - need to verify if message board has thread detail modals
   - If exists, check positioning

### Root Cause:
- Blog modal had `position: sticky` on `.modal-header-bar` which made the avatar follow the scroll
- User wants avatar to scroll away naturally (stay at top, not follow viewport)
- Chronicles was already correct with `position: relative`

### Fix Applied:
Changed `.modal-header-bar` in `blog-modal.css`:
```css
/* OLD - Avatar stuck to viewport */
position: sticky;
top: 0;
z-index: 100;

/* NEW - Avatar scrolls away */
position: relative;
```

### Next Steps:
- [x] Read modal CSS files
- [x] Identify which modals have scroll issues
- [x] Fix Soul Scrolls modal (remove sticky positioning)
- [x] Verify Chronicles modal (already correct)
- [ ] Check Thread modal existence
- [ ] Test on mobile and desktop

## üìù DESIGN GLITCHES TO CHECK

### General:
- [ ] Button styling consistency across sections
- [ ] Spacing and padding issues
- [ ] Mobile responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Color contrast for accessibility
- [ ] Animation smoothness
- [ ] Loading states

### Component-Specific:
- [ ] Poll section - looks good on all screen sizes?
- [ ] Mindmap preview - zoom/pan smooth?
- [ ] Highlights sections - styling consistent?
- [ ] Theme toggle - works everywhere?

   - Effort: Low (CSS fix: make header sticky)
   - Risk: Minimal (CSS change only)

3. **üü° MEDIUM**: Remove duplicate Chronicles voting code
   - Impact: Code maintenance, potential bugs
   - Effort: Low (delete old updateVotingUI method)
   - Risk: None if unified voting is working (need to verify)

4. **üü¢ LOW**: Check Thread modal existence and fix if needed
   - Impact: Unknown (need to verify modal exists)
   - Effort: Low-Medium
   - Risk: Low

5. **üü¢ LOW**: Design polish and consistency checks
   - Impact: Visual consistency
   - Effort: Variable
   - Risk: Low

**‚úÖ Blog Modal Avatar**: Already fixed (sticky header)
**‚ùå Chronicle Modal Avatar**: Needs fix (avatar scrolls with content)
**‚ö†Ô∏è Thread Modal**: Not found during audit (may not exist)
