## 💬 Messaging Systems

### Real-time Messaging: ✅ Complete
- WebSocket-based persistent messaging system
- Instant message delivery and receipt
- Message history and persistence
- Integration with user profiles and online status

### 🦉 Owl Email Sharing

### Current Status: ✅ Functional with Fallback
The owl messaging feature for sharing blog posts via email is **fully functional** with smart fallback handling.

**How it works:**
- Users click "🦉 Whisper this scroll to another soul" on any blog post
- Enter recipient's email address
- System attempts to send via backend email service
- If email service unavailable (404/500 errors), gracefully falls back to:
  - `mailto:` link to open user's email client
  - URL copied to clipboard for manual sharing
  - User-friendly messaging: "The owl's message service is resting!"

### 🔧 Future Email Service Enhancement
**Implementation Required:**
To enable full server-side email delivery, configure these environment variables in Render:

```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com           # Or your preferred SMTP service
EMAIL_PORT=465                      # 465 for SSL, 587 for TLS
EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com    # SMTP username
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password        # SMTP password/API key
EMAIL_FROM=Ancient Scrolls <noreply@mlnf.net>  # Optional sender address
```

**Backend Status:** ✅ Ready - `back/routes/owls.js` already implements full email functionality
**Frontend Status:** ✅ Ready - Automatically switches to full email when backend configured

**Priority:** Low (fallback solution works excellently and may be preferable for privacy)
