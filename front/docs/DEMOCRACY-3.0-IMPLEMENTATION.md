## 🎯 **CORE PLATFORM IDENTITY**

## 🏛️ **GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Constitutional Framework:**
```
UNTOUCHABLE TIER (Natural Law Protected):
├── Property rights (admin retains legal ownership)
├── Free speech (no community censorship of ideas)
├── Individual privacy (personal data protection)
├── Basic platform existence (can't vote to shut down)
└── Constitutional interpretation (community votes on meaning)

DEMOCRATIC TIER (Community Authority):
├── Operational decisions (features, policies, resource allocation)
├── Content moderation (community standards & enforcement)
├── Featured content selection (community voting)
├── User discipline (deportation/banning decisions)
└── Resource allocation (surplus funds distribution)

ADMIN TIER (Executor Authority):
├── Technical implementation of voted decisions
├── Emergency platform maintenance
├── Smart contract emulation (pre-Web3)
└── Constitutional dispute facilitation
```

### **Decision Implementation Process:**
- **Admin as "Executor of Community Will"**
- **Smart contract emulation** until Web3 transition
- **Community votes become binding** (no admin veto power)
- **Constitutional limits** protect both community and admin
- **Democratic interpretation** of constitutional questions
