## **[Previous Session - 2025-01-02] - Online Status Indicator System Fix**

### üîç **Critical Bug Resolution: Site-wide Online Status Indicators**

#### **üö® Major Issue Resolved: Online Status Indicators Not Displaying**
**Problem**: Online status indicators (green pulsing dots) were only working in Active Users Sidebar, but failing across all other site components despite backend data showing users as online.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **CSS Conflicts**: Duplicate `.online-dot` styles in multiple CSS files causing cascade conflicts
2. **Missing Backend Data**: API populate queries missing `online` field for author data
3. **Frontend Caching**: localStorage caching preventing immediate display of updated data
4. **Loading Order Issues**: Some components not safely checking for NexusAvatars availability

**Systematic Resolution Process**:
1. **CSS Conflict Resolution**:
   - Removed duplicate `.online-dot` styles from `active-users.css` and `sidebar.css`
   - Fixed keyframe animation conflicts by renaming `immortalPulse` to `immortalTextPulse` for text animations
   - Removed legacy `.online-indicator` classes from `souls-listing.css`
   - Centralized all online status styling in global `styles.css`

2. **Backend API Enhancement**:
   - Updated Chronicles API (`/api/chronicles`) to include `online` field in author population
   - Updated Blog Posts API (`/api/blogs`) to include `online` field in author population  
   - Updated News API (`/api/news`) to include `online` field in author population
   - Ensured consistent data structure across all content APIs

3. **Frontend Cache Management**:
   - Added cache-busting headers to API client for fresh data retrieval
   - Implemented progressive cache refresh allowing step-by-step fix deployment
   - Reduced Souls directory cache time from 5 minutes to 30 seconds for testing

4. **Component Integration Verification**:
   - Confirmed all components using new Immortal Nexus Avatar System with proper safety checks
   - Updated individual Soul pages to use unified avatar system
   - Verified cross-site compatibility and loading order

#### **‚úÖ System-wide Fix Achieved**
**Online Status Indicators Now Working In**:
- ‚úÖ Active Users Sidebar (confirmed working)
- ‚úÖ Chronicles Highlights on front page  
- ‚úÖ Boundless Chronicles news cards
- ‚úÖ Soul Scrolls blog posts and modals
- ‚úÖ Souls Directory profile cards
- ‚úÖ Individual Soul profile pages
- ‚úÖ All content modals and previews

#### **üìÅ Files Modified**
**Frontend**:
- `css/styles.css` - Fixed keyframe conflicts, centralized online dot styles
- `css/active-users.css` - Removed duplicate online dot styles and unused classes
- `css/sidebar.css` - Removed conflicting online status styles
- `css/souls-listing.css` - Removed legacy online indicator classes
- `js/shared/apiClient.js` - Added cache-busting headers

## **Recent Development Sessions**

### **Session: June 10, 2025**

#### **üéØ Goals:**
-   Deploy backend updates.
-   Diagnose and fix frontend layout and functionality bugs.

#### **‚úÖ Fixes & Improvements:**

-   **Echoes Unbound (Message Board):**

## Session Summary: [Current Date] - Header Auth & Active Users Button Refinement

**Objective:** Refine header authentication display and Active Users sidebar button functionality.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Header Authentication UI Overhaul:**
    *   **Logged-Out State:**
        *   Removed the "Guest" user dropdown from the main header.
        *   Implemented two stacked buttons ("Embrace Immortality" & "Enter Sanctuary") in the header's top-right for logged-out users. These buttons trigger the authentication modal.
        *   Relevant files: `front/index.html` (added `#headerAuthButtonsContainer`), `front/css/styles.css` (styled new buttons), `front/components/shared/userMenu.js` (updated logic to toggle display and populate new button container).
    *   **Logged-In State:**
        *   The standard user dropdown menu remains in place for logged-in users.
        *   Relevant files: `front/components/shared/userMenu.js` (updated logic).

2.  **Active Users Sidebar Button (`#showUsersBtn`):**
    *   **Conditional Visibility:** The button is now only displayed to logged-in users. It's hidden when no user is logged in.
    *   **Enhanced Styling:** The button's visual appearance was significantly upgraded (larger, rounded-square, gradient background, dynamic hover/active effects).
    *   Relevant files: `front/components/shared/activeUsers.js` (added `updateActiveUsersButtonVisibility()` and integrated it into init and global Immortal Nexus object), `front/components/shared/userMenu.js` (calls visibility update on auth state change), `front/css/active-users.css` (new button styles).

**Overall Impact:**
*   Improved clarity in the header UI, distinguishing more effectively between logged-in and guest states.
*   Enhanced the visual appeal and contextual relevance of the Active Users sidebar button.

## Session Summary: May 28, 2025 - Critical Authentication & Profile System Fixes

**Objective:** Resolve critical registration failures and implement functional public profile system.

**Critical Issues Resolved:**

1.  **Registration System Complete Overhaul:**
    *   **Root Cause Identified:** Frontend calling `/auth/register` while backend expected `/auth/signup` - causing 401 errors and JSON parse failures.
    *   **Files Fixed:** 
        *   `front/components/shared/authModal.js` - Updated endpoint from `/auth/register` to `/auth/signup`
        *   `front/js/scripts.js` - Updated duplicate registration logic to use correct endpoint
    *   **Enhanced User Experience:** 
        *   Registration now automatically logs users in (backend returns token + user data)
        *   Eliminated manual login step after successful registration
        *   Updated success message: "Eternity claimed! Welcome to the Sanctuary."
        *   Added automatic page refresh to show logged-in state
    *   **Added Missing Function:** Created `isLoggedIn()` helper function that was being called but not defined

2.  **Public Profile System Architecture:**
    *   **Dynamic Template System:** Confirmed `/souls/[username].html` serves as universal template for all user profiles
    *   **URL Routing Fixed:** Updated `front/_redirects` configuration:
        *   OLD (broken): `/souls/:username ‚Üí /pages/souls/profile.html?username=:username`
        *   NEW (working): `/souls/:username ‚Üí /souls/[username].html`
    *   **Backend API Enhanced:** 
        *   Added `online` status field to `GET /users/:username` endpoint in `back/routes/users.js`
        *   Profile endpoint now returns: `username`, `displayName`, `avatar`, `status`, `bio`, `createdAt`, `online`

3.  **System Integration Improvements:**
    *   **Consistent Token Handling:** Both login and registration now store session token and user data identically
    *   **Real-time UI Updates:** Authentication state changes immediately update user interface
    *   **Error Handling:** Improved feedback for authentication failures with specific error messages

**Technical Architecture Confirmed:**
*   **Profile URL Flow:** `https://immortal.nexus/souls/username` ‚Üí Netlify redirects ‚Üí `/souls/[username].html` ‚Üí JavaScript extracts username ‚Üí API call ‚Üí Dynamic rendering
*   **Authentication Flow:** Registration ‚Üí Backend returns token + user data ‚Üí Frontend stores both ‚Üí Auto-login ‚Üí UI refresh
*   **API Endpoints:** All authentication and user management endpoints verified and functional

## Session Summary: [Date of This Session] - Extensive Spring Cleaning & Refactoring

**Objective:** Organize codebase, remove redundancies, ensure efficiency, and prepare for future development. Vanilla JS frontend, Express.js/MongoDB backend.

**Key Changes & Achievements:**

1.  **Project Structure & Git:**
    *   Standardized frontend to `Immortal Nexus/front/` and backend to `Immortal Nexus/back/`.
    *   Resolved Git "too many active changes" error in `Immortal Nexus/back/` by correcting `.gitignore` and untracking `node_modules` contents.

2.  **File System Cleanup (Frontend):**
    *   Consolidated `dev-log.md` into `Immortal Nexus/front/`.
    *   Deleted several redundant/old HTML files and a `package-lock.json` from an incorrect location.
    *   Confirmed removal of nested `Immortal Nexus/front/Immortal Nexus/` folder.
    *   Created `Immortal Nexus/front/_redirects` for Cloudflare Pages from a legacy `.htaccess` file. The `.htaccess` file was later confirmed as not present and thus didn't require deletion.

3.  **CSS Externalization & Standardization (`Immortal Nexus/front/`):
    *   **`profile-setup.html`**: Inline styles moved to `css/profile-setup.css`.
    *   **`base-theme.css`**: Created to centralize CSS custom properties (`:root`) from various files.
    *   **`styles.css` (main stylesheet)**: Removed its local `:root` (merged one variable to `base-theme.css`).
    *   **`blog.html`**: Inline styles moved to `css/blog.css`.
    *   **`messageboard.html`**: Inline styles moved to `css/messageboard.css`.
    *   **`souls/index.html`**: Large inline `<style>` block's content was moved. Page-specific styles were consolidated into `css/souls-listing.css` (which was cleaned of global style duplications). Generic/global styles from the inline block were added/merged into `css/styles.css`. The HTML file itself will need manual removal of the now-redundant `<style>` tags.
    *   All relevant HTML files updated to link `base-theme.css` and their specific stylesheets.

4.  **CSS Consolidation (Shared vs. Main - `Immortal Nexus/front/`):
    *   **User Menu, Mobile Nav Toggle, Soul Modal**: Styles were removed/confirmed to be primarily in `components/shared/styles.css`, removing them from `styles.css`.
    *   **Active Users Sidebar**: Styles moved from `styles.css` to `css/active-users.css`.
    *   **Message Modal**: Styles consolidated into `components/shared/styles.css` (from `active-users.css` and `styles.css`). The content class was renamed from `.auth-modal` to `.message-modal-content` in CSS and relevant HTML files.
    *   **`styles.css` Full Refactor**: The main `styles.css` was manually replaced with a cleaner version focusing on global styles, generic elements, and page structure, excluding component-specific rules.
    *   `@keyframes modalContentAppear` moved from `styles.css` to `components/shared/styles.css`.

5.  **Shared JavaScript Components & Refactoring (`Immortal Nexus/front/`):
    *   **`messageModal.js`**: Created as a new shared component from inline JS in `lander.html`.
    *   **`index.html`**: Corrected JS path, removed redundant inline JS for Active Users and Message Modal.
    *   **`lander.html`**: Removed large commented-out JS block.
    *   **`souls/index.html`**: JavaScript was reviewed. Page-specific logic (fetching/rendering profiles, search) remains. Redundant initializers for shared components were confirmed removed. Added missing script tag for `js/user-sidebar.js` (its page-specific sidebar).
    *   **`profile-setup.html`**: Refactored inline JS to use global config and shared auth functions.
    *   **`blog.html`**: Inline JS (including `jwt-decode` and Active Users logic) moved to `js/blog.js`. Redundant Active Users logic removed from `js/blog.js`.
    *   **`authModal.js`**: A dead call to a non-existent `updateUserSidebar` function was identified for manual removal.

**Overall Impact:**
*   Significantly improved codebase organization, modularity, and maintainability.
*   Reduced CSS and JavaScript redundancy, promoting better caching and performance.
*   Established clearer patterns for managing global styles, component-specific styles, and shared JavaScript functionality.
*   The project is now in a much stronger position for ongoing and future development.

## [Version 1.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### üöÄ Features & Architectural Improvements
- **Centralized API Client (`apiClient.js`):** Implemented a new, site-wide API client to standardize all backend communication. This client automatically handles auth tokens, headers, and provides consistent error handling, preventing a wide range of common bugs.
- **Standardized Component Model:** Refactored the News page (`news.html`) to use the new `apiClient`, establishing it as the gold-standard template for future page development and refactoring.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Chronicle Submission Fixed:** Resolved a critical `500 Internal Server Error` that occurred when submitting new chronicles. The issue was a data format mismatch where the frontend sent a `sources` array while the backend expected a string.
- **API Response Handling:** Improved the `news.html` page to correctly parse paginated API responses (using the `docs` array), fixing an issue where new content would not appear.
- **Modal Functionality:** Corrected multiple modal issues on `news.html`, including the "Submit Your Truth" button and "Eternal Seekers" sidebar modals, which previously failed to open.
- **Disappearing Content:** Addressed a race condition on the news page where content would load and then be immediately cleared by other scripts.

### üîß Developer Experience
- **Automated Push Scripts:** Created `qpush.bat` and `quick-push.ps1` to dramatically simplify and speed up the process of pushing changes to the repository.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Added extensive, detailed logging to the chronicle submission process, enabling rapid diagnosis of the server-side 500 error.
