# Eternal Souls Highlight Section ðŸ‘¥âœ¨

## What It Is

Two spots on the homepage:
1. **ImmortalAl's spot** - so people can find and message you, read your work
2. **Maybe sometimes another community member** - just because

No systems, no recognition, no schedules. Just because.

## Technical Implementation

Uses the existing avatar system with standard message and profile buttons. Clean presentation.

## Interesting Future Possibilities

- **Collaborative Projects** - space for community members to organize projects together
- **Workshops** - room on the website for community skill sharing ideas
- Video introductions, newsletter, natural mentorship (maybe, if they happen organically)

---

*Sometimes things exist just because they do.*
