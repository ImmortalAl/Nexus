# Immortal Nexus Development Roadmap

## Site Audit Summary
Based on comprehensive codebase analysis:
- **Strengths**: Modular backend with good model structure; Real-time features via WebSockets; Responsive frontend design.
- **Weaknesses**: Large monolithic files (e.g., lander.html at 2981 lines); Duplicated CSS; No testing framework; Limited scalability in database queries.
- **Opportunities**: Implement CI/CD for faster deployment; Add unit tests; Optimize for growth.
- **Threats**: Potential performance issues with user growth; Security vulnerabilities in untested code.

## Top 5 Improvements
1. **Implement Unit Testing**: Add Jest for frontend/backend tests to catch bugs early.
2. **Set Up CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
3. **Enhance Scalability**: Add database indexing, caching (e.g., Redis), and query optimization.
4. **Refactor Large Files**: Modularize lander.html and other large HTML/JS files.
5. **Improve Security**: Add rate limiting, input validation, and regular audits.
