      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfix: CRITICAL - resolve user menu wrapping issue by fixing viewport-optimizations.css universal max-width rule\n\nFixed mobile header layout where user dropdown menu was appearing below the header instead of staying on the same horizontal line with the hamburger menu.\n\nRoot Cause:\n- viewport-optimizations.css had a universal `* { max-width: 100%; }` rule (line 696-699)\n- This CSS file loads AFTER shared/styles.css, overriding the `max-width: none` fixes\n- The universal rule was forcing header flex children to wrap to new lines on narrow viewports\n- Despite header having `flex-wrap: nowrap`, the max-width constraint was causing layout breaks\n\nChanges:\n- Modified viewport-optimizations.css universal selector to EXCLUDE header elements:\n  - Excluded: header, header *, .header-controls, .header-controls *, .user-menu, .user-menu *, .mobile-nav-toggle, .logo, .logo *\n  - Added explicit rule for header elements with NO max-width constraint\n- Bumped viewport-optimizations.css version from 1.1 to 1.2\n- Updated version reference in ALL HTML files (14 files total)\n\nTechnical Details:\n- The universal `max-width: 100%` was meant to prevent horizontal scroll\n- However, it was breaking flex layouts in the header where elements need to stay on one line\n- The fix allows header elements to flex properly without width constraints\n- Other page elements still have the max-width protection to prevent horizontal scroll\n\nThis fix addresses the recurring header layout issue that has been attempted to be fixed in previous commits:\n- \"fix: CRITICAL mobile header layout - prevent vertical stacking\" (a1cda89)\n- \"fix: Remove flex constraints forcing avatar out of header\" (419961a)\n- \"fix: CRITICAL - prevent avatar from wrapping to new line below header\" (5b95ca0)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
